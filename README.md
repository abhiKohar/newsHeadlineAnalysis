# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in looking at Times of India News headline dataset from 2001-2020 to understand:
1. What Indian media is talking about before Covid-19 and after Covid-19?
2. How are the political parties represented in the media?
3. What were the political parties were talking about during the 2019 general elections?
