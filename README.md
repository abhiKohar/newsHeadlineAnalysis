# Installation
The project uses python 3 and all the installations can be done using the requirements.txt file.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in looking at Times of India News headline dataset from 2001-2020 to understand:
1. What Indian media is talking about before Covid-19 and after Covid-19?
2. How are the political parties represented in the media?
3. What were the political parties were talking about during the 2019 general elections?


# File Descriptions
requirements.txt contains all the required packages and 
.ipynb notebook contains the analysis.

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available on medium [here](https://abhinavkohar007.medium.com/what-issues-do-indian-media-talk-about-96a58c4eed8).
